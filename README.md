Thank for [oraoto/pulsar-client-phpcpp](https://github.com/oraoto/pulsar-client-phpcpp).
When I want to use pulsar by PHP, first time I use websocket, then I found this project.
This project seems no longer update, I need more function, so I relay this job.
Cpp is greatÔºÅIt can help PHPer to develop PHP extension and do more.
